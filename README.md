# MultiModal-Video-Discovery
- Searching the metadata for information Detecting as many shot types as possible (e.g., long shot, medium shot, American shot, close-up, extreme close-up) 
- Detecting shot transitions (cuts) Identifying objects, locations, people, actions, etc. in single shots Accepting an input image and retrieving all scenes with similar visual composition 
- Also: Any additional search feature that you find appropriate or particularly relevant to the dataset And ideally: combining all the above into a chatbot that can process complex queries, such as (but of course not limited to):
- “Find a scene from 1940s Germany in which a woman is working with a machine in a medium shot.”
- “Find a film where a medium shot of a soldier cuts to a close-up of his face.”
- “Find all films made after 1945 that contain shots resembling the input image.”
